Description: Cuddy-Della valle index gives the degree of instability present in the data by accommodating the effect of a trend. The adjusted R squared value of the best fitted model is chosen. The index is obtained by multiplying the coefficient of variation with square root of one minus the adjusted R-squared value. This package has been developed using concept of Shankar et al. (2022)<doi:10.3389/fsufs.2023.1208898>.
